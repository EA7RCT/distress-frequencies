         !: Indicates usually well-monitored or active frequencies (!: a lot / *: somewhat).
 Frequency: Channel frequency or digital radio channel.
      Mode: Modulation, subtones, encoding, etc.
    Domain: Application domain or channel attribution.
     Alias: Common name of the frequency/channel.
    Region: Where the frequency is monitored.
   Comment: Any other relevant considerations.


Comments:
* Frequencies are roughly sorted by domain from more to less monitored for emergencies.
* Within a domain, frequencies are sorted from low to high.


Recommendations:
* Memorize the emergency phone number of the area(s) you will be traveling. Outside the aeronautical
  or maritime domain it is usually better to use your phone (if available).
* State your location before your emergency. If communication breaks, its more important for
  rescuers to know where to find you than to know what is going on.
* If using 2m or 70cm Amateur Radio, lookup local repeaters in advance. They are well monitored, but
  remember that they usually have different TX and RX frequencies and may also require a subtone.
